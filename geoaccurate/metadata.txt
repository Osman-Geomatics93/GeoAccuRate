description=Accuracy assessment done right — Olofsson, Pontius, and publication-ready reports in one click.
about=GeoAccuRate provides statistically rigorous accuracy assessment for land cover
    and remote sensing classification validation in QGIS. It implements the area-weighted
    estimation method of Olofsson et al. (2014), Pontius quantity and allocation
    disagreement metrics, Wilson confidence intervals, and automated stratified random
    sampling with sample size optimization. Generates publication-ready PDF reports with
    confusion matrices (counts and row-normalized), per-class metrics, interpretation
    notes, ISO 19157 quality element mapping, and auto-generated methods text with
    citations. Designed for researchers, students, and agencies requiring reproducible
    and defensible accuracy assessment without leaving QGIS.
